Project Title:
Inventory and Supply Chain Management Dashboard using Power BI

Objective:
To design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights into key supply chain metrics—such as warehouse utilization, transportation costs, inventory turnover, lead times, and sales performance. The objective is to help businesses monitor supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, manage inventory levels effectively, and make data-driven decisions across regions and product categories.
✅ S - Situation:
A company needed to monitor and optimize its supply chain operations, which include warehouse utilization, inventory turnover, transportation costs, sales trends, and backlog management. The objective was to improve visibility and decision-making across regions and product categories.
✅ T - Task:
The task was to design an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) across the inventory and supply chain process, enabling stakeholders to:
Track warehouse utilization efficiency
Evaluate sales and inventory performance
Identify transportation cost distribution
Monitor backorders and lead times
✅ A - Action:
Developed and structured the dashboard using Power BI with the following key visual components:
KPIs Cards (Left Panel):
Warehouse Utilisation: 33%
Days Sales of Inventory: 15 days
Inventory Turnover Ratio: 23
Filters (Slicers):
By Region East, West, North, South
By Category Accessories, Furniture, Electronics, Clothing
Key Visualizations:
Warehouse Utilisation Gauge: Shows 32.87% utilization compared to a target (75%).
Transportation Cost by Region and Category: Bar chart comparing categories in the East region.
Units Sold by Year (2020–2024): Line chart showing a growth trend from 16K (2020) to a peak of 50K (2023), then a dip in 2024 (45K).
Average Lead Time by Category: Donut chart showing lead time distribution across 5 categories.
Backorders by Order Status: Bar chart showing 202 fulfilled, 52 pending, and 30 canceled orders.
Inventory Level by Category and Region: Bar chart showing the sum of inventory level by product category in the East region.
✅ R - Result:
Enabled data-driven decision-making by providing a clear view of inventory performance and supply chain bottlenecks.
Helped the business reduce backorders, identify underutilized warehouses, and optimize inventory levels by category and region.
Facilitated forecasting and planning using historical sales trends.
Improved communication between operations, logistics, and management teams.
